#### Description

Workshops are practical, hands-on sessions designed to impart new skills in the use of FOSS4G software. They showcase current and emerging technologies and provide direct interaction between our experienced OSGeo community members and attendees eager to learn or enhance their skills.

Each workshop is either 2 or 4 hours long and will take place two days prior to the main conference. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops. Please clearly indicate if prior installation of any specific software is required.

When submitting a workshop proposal, use the abstract to clearly define the scope and content. Including a list of topics you intend to cover is highly encouraged. Ideally, you should also specify any prerequisite skills, such as basic knowledge of Python programming.

You will be asked to indicate the difficulty level of the workshop on a scale from 1 (beginner) to 3 (advanced).

The FOSS4G Europe 2025 Local Organizing Committee recognizes the significant effort involved in preparing a successful and educational workshop. Therefore, accepted workshop presenters will be offered a complimentary ticket to the main conference program.

#### Selection Process

Following the submission period, there will be a two-week community voting phase for the proposed workshops. The results of the community vote will serve as a recommendation, but the final decision rests with the volunteer Program Committee. Community voting is essential for assigning rooms and planning capacities to ensure participants have the best possible FOSS4G experience.
