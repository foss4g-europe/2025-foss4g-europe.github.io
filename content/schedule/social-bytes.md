the end of the Bosnian War. It was created through a partnership between the
humanitarian organization War Child and globally renowned artists including
Luciano Pavarotti, Brian Eno, and members of U2. The centre was envisioned as
a space for healing, creativity, and cultural exchange in a city deeply
scarred by conflict. Its mission was not only to support the post-war recovery
of Mostar but also to offer young people an alternative to violence and trauma
through music and art.

The building itself dates back to 1908, constructed during the Austro-Hungarian
era as a primary school. During the war, it was damaged, but thanks to
international solidarity and cultural diplomacy, it was restored and repurposed
into a cultural beacon. Pavarotti himself visited Mostar, lending his name and
influence to a project that was as symbolic as it was practical. The centre
became an emblem of artistic resistance and peacebuilding, inspiring similar
initiatives around the world.

From its earliest days, the Pavarotti Music Centre hosted concerts, exhibitions,
and cross-cultural projects that brought together youth from both sides of the
divided city. It offered psychological support, music education, and a safe
space for self-expression. The emphasis was not only on performance but also on
the transformative power of music to foster dialogue and reconciliation. Over
the decades, the centre has remained dedicated to promoting peace through
creativity. Its founding story continues to inspire generations of artists,
educators, and community leaders across the Balkans.

#### Current Activities

Today, the Pavarotti Music Centre remains one of the most important cultural
institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It functions as a multidisciplinary
creative hub that serves young people, musicians, dancers, actors, and
educators from Mostar and beyond. The centre regularly offers music education
programs, including classes for various instruments, vocal coaching, and sound
engineering. It also provides rehearsal spaces and professional-grade recording
studios for local bands and artists.

In addition to music, the centre runs a variety of workshops in contemporary
dance, visual arts, theatre, and creative writing. These programs are designed
not only to teach technical skills but also to encourage personal growth,
teamwork, and intercultural understanding.

The Pavarotti Music Centre is also a vibrant venue for cultural events,
including concerts, film screenings, festivals, and conferences. It
collaborates with NGOs, schools, and international partners to host exchange
programs and artistic residencies. Importantly, the centre plays an educational
role, organizing seminars, public lectures, and training for educators and
youth workers. It continues to embrace technology, offering digital media labs
and promoting creative entrepreneurship through innovation and skill-building.

What makes the centre unique is its commitment to inclusivity and
community-driven culture. Everyone - from professional artists to absolute
beginners - finds a place here. As a cultural landmark and safe space for
expression, it has become a pillar of civil society in Mostar. The legacy of
its founders lives on not only in its name, but in the spirit of every project
that emerges from its halls.


#### Why at the Pavarotti Centre?

For the FOSS4G community, the Pavarotti Music Centre is more than just a
venue-it's a symbol of connection, openness, and creativity. Hosting the
Social Bytes evening here offers an ideal opportunity for informal networking,
idea exchange, and enjoyment in an inspiring setting that celebrates the power
of community and art.

#### AD/HD is our host

We are proud to introduce the band that will bring the sound and soul to our
Social Bytes evening. As we bring ADHD to our data, they bring it to their
music! AD/HD is a group of friends and musicians who usually perform in
different bands, but for this night, they are coming together with one
purpose - Rock 'n' Roll.

This ensemble will channel their passion for music through timeless hits of the
Balkan rock scene from the 70s, 80s, and 90s - an era when rock music was not
just entertainment but a cultural movement. In addition to regional classics,
they'll spice up the night with iconic global rock hits that shaped
generations around the world.

Expect energy, nostalgia, and some serious musical craftsmanship - a perfect
match for the collaborative and open spirit of FOSS4G.
