**Wednesday (16 July), Thursday (17 July) 2025**  
Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are unstructured timeslots where people can
self-organise themselves to discuss topics of interest. So, if there are any
specific topics you'd like to discuss face-to-face with other people this is
exactly the chance.

BoF's can be held in BoF rooms at specified timeslots or taken off-site for
breakfast, lunch, or dinner!

More information coming soon!
