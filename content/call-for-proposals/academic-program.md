In line with established tradition, the FOSS4G Mostar 2025 conference will feature an Academic Track organized by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), specifically the ISPRS Intercommission Working Group IV/III/II on Openness in Geospatial Science and Remote Sensing. 

The Scientific Committee invites original research contributions on topics related to free and open-source geospatial software, including but not limited to:

- Open hardware  
- Open-source software development  
- Open geospatial science  
- Open geospatial data  
- (Geo)spatial data sharing systems  
- Open geospatial cloud platforms and services  
- Open geo education  
- Participatory mapping and Crowdsourced geospatial data and sitizen science
- IoT in geospatial world
- Blockchain technology in geospatial data
- Geospatial data privacy and security
- Application of open geospatial tools in agriculture
- Geospatial application in renewable energy 
- Digital Twins  
- GeoAI and geospatial machine learning  
- Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models  
- Applications of GIS in spatial planning  
- Urban and regional planning using open-source geospatial tools  
- Environmental monitoring and management  
- Disaster risk assessment and management  
- Smart cities and sustainable development  
- Geospatial data visualization and cartography  
- Remote sensing applications  
- Geospatial data interoperability and standards  
- Geospatial aspects of climate change studies  

Given the European focus of the conference, authors are encouraged to develop applications and use cases with a European scope, driven by European policy initiatives, or utilizing datasets from prominent European initiatives such as INSPIRE and Copernicus.

We welcome all types of papers, including results achieved, case studies, work in progress, reviews, and demos. However, we discourage mere presentations of technology or use cases without properly justifying originality against the scientific state of the art and without particular novelty. The use of open-source geospatial software and its impact on the work should be properly highlighted. Contributions from PhD students and early-stage researchers are particularly encouraged.

In evaluating proposals, the Scientific Committee will pay particular attention to the reproducibility of the research, where applicable. Reproducibility is ensured when the research makes all artifacts (input data, computational steps, methods, and code) openly available to obtain consistent results. When available, the code should be publicly released under an open-source license.

**Note!** Call for proposals for the academic program for FOSS4G Europe 2025 will be opened soon. We will announce them in due course on our social media channels and some select mailing lists. ðŸ˜Š
