## FOSS4GE 2025 Travel Grant Programme (TGP)
The **F** in FOSS4G stands for Free and freedom is not only important for software
or data, but it is also important for the community in which everybody can freely
participate. For years
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.osgeo.org/initiatives/foss4g-travel-grant-program/"
    title="OSGeo has provided a Travel Grant Programme (TGP)"
>}}**
for its conferences to increase the accessibility and diversity of FOSS4G events.
The Mostar local organising committee is happy to provide travel grants in
cooperation with OSGeo also for FOSS4G Europe 2025.

### Travel Grants
Every grant includes a free conference pass, one free workshop, and a grant
fund of up to 300€ that can be used for travelling and/or accommodation expenses.
The number and size of grants may be adjusted by the FOSS4GE 2025
Travel Grant Committee based on the amount of funds raised for TGP.

Applying for travel grants is open to everyone with only a few rules:
- Being a regional conference, travel grants for FOSS4G Europe 2025 are only
available to residents of
**{{<
    extlink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_in_Europe"
    title="European countries"
>}}**. This is a regional conference and
a chance to attract more Europeans to the free and open source community.
- Although Bosnia and Herzegovina is located in Europe, permanent residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina are not
eligible to receive travel grants.
- Everyone receiving a travel grant is expected to do volunteer work for at
least 12 hours during the conference. This is a way to strengthen the OSGeo
community and will help to create a better conference experience for everyone.

The purpose of the travel grant programme is to enhance diversity at the
conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and
outstanding applications. However, the majority of programme spots will solely
be determined by the point ranking. In case of equal points, the distance
between the applicant's hometown and Mostar is measured and the applicant
coming from farther away wins.

Please consider applying for a smaller grant (up to 200 €). It would score you
more ranking points and also leave the committee with more funds for additional
grants.

### Scoring principles

- **2 points** if you apply for a smaller grant (up to 200€)
- **2 points** if you have accepted talk(s) or workshop(s)
- **2 points** for previous proven involvement in OSGeo projects or community
building activities
- **1 point** if you proposed talk(s) and/or workshop(s) but they were not accepted
- **1 point** of being enrolled as a student (including PhD student)
- **1 point** for permanent residence in any European country NOT defined as a
high-income economy.

data puts the following 15 countries into this group: Albania, Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, Türkiye.

### Important dates
- **_February 2025_** - FOSS4G Europe 2025 TGP opens, start sending your applications

### Payment
We expect grantees to  be able to fund the direct costs of travelling to the
FOSS4G Europe conference. Successful applicants will receive conference passes
and will become eligible for reimbursement of expenses up to the limit of the
travel grant. Paying out the monetary part of TGP will be carried out
during/after the conference by direct transfer to the recipient’s bank account
only based on the actual expenses up to the total grant limit, meaning that you
need to submit your train/bus/flight tickets/invoices and accommodation invoices
that you want to have covered. Details will be managed at check-in time at the
conference registration desk.

For exceptional cases when the monetary grant will be needed in advance or
specific costs need to be covered directly, please contact the organisers of
the conference.

**Please note!** Receivers of travel grants need to arrange necessary visas and
other documents needed to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina to attend the conference themselves.
You can get more information on visas from the
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.mvp.gov.ba/konzularne_informacije/vize/default.aspx"
    title="Bosnia and Herzegovina Ministry of Foreign Affairs"
>}}**.

### Supporting the TGP
The funding of travel grants comes from:
- [**Conference sponsors**](/sponsors/)
- **{{<
    extlink href="https://www.osgeo.org/sponsors/"
    title="Sponsors of OSGeo"
>}}**
- Annual commitment from the  OSGeo board

You can help make the FOSS4G conferences more accessible and increase the
diversity of attendees by
[**becoming a sponsor of the conference**](/sponsors/call-for-sponsors/)
or by
**{{<
    extlink href="https://www.osgeo.org/about/how-to-become-a-sponsor/"
    title="donating money directly to OSGeo"
>}}** .

An easy way to support is to
[**Adopt-a-ticket**](/registration/adopt-a-ticket/) during your own
[**registration**](/registration/) to the event. The
proceeds from **adopt-a-ticket** will be used to cover costs
for workshop presenters and TGP applicants' gratis entrance. With at least one
_ticket adoption_ you will be included as an honourable mention in our
conference channels. If you buy more, you are instead eligible for one of the
different sponsorship levels at equal value which you can find in the FOSS4GE 2025
[**Call for Sponsors**](/sponsors/call-for-sponsors/).

### About the TGP

collaboration with representatives from each FOSS4G event.
