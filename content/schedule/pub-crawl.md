## Pubs and Nightlife in Mostar

There are many great pubs, bars, and cafés scattered across Mostar. The Local Organizing Committee
has selected a few that capture the lively and welcoming atmosphere of the city. We are sharing these
recommendations to offer you more opportunities to meet fellow conference-goers for late-night (
and early morning!) discussions on topics related to free and open source geospatial technologies.
You might meet up with a presenter to discuss their session in more detail, or connect in person with
developers and users of your favorite open-source tools — people you may have previously known
only by their @-handle or email address.

Mostar’s nightlife is vibrant and diverse, with many venues located around the
old town and along the picturesque Neretva River. During the summer evenings,
many places offer outdoor seating with stunning views, combining relaxed
Mediterranean vibes with the city's rich cultural heritage.

Our partner pubs and bars will be marked with special FOSS4G Europe 2025 signs during the
conference week, making it easy for you to find them. Feel free to step
in, meet new people, and even ask for a custom FOSS4GE conference drink!

Whether you are looking for a cozy place to unwind, a lively spot for socializing,
or a venue with live music and local wines, pubs in Mostar provide the
perfect backdrop for memorable moments.
