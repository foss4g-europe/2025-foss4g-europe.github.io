We are excited to welcome you at the HOT Tech Team Community Drone Mapping
Workshop and/or the  Collaborative Field Mapping Sessions! The sessions are
**OPEN** and **FREE** to join. You can drop in. We do encourage you to
**{{< extlink

    title="fill in this form"

with you before and after the sessions. If any question, feel free to
email [**petya.kangalova@hotosm.org**](mailto:petya.kangalova@hotosm.org)

**Summary**: Drone imagery and data is useful for mapping, disaster resilience,
and a variety of humanitarian, development, and economic activities, but
drone mapping tools have not been well-adapted to community use in development
and humanitarian contexts - until now.  The Drone Tasking Manager (DroneTM) is
a suite of tools for communities to use low-cost, safe, accessible drones to
collect high-quality aerial imagery and data on the scale of thousands of
square kilometers.

**Aim**: would like to offer a free workshop in which participants will:
- Use the Drone Tasking Manager desktop application to create projects,
defining and Area of Interest to cover with multiple drones by multiple teams
concurrently.
- Use the DroneTM mobile Web app to create, access, and download individual
flight plans for low-cost drones
- Execute short (~15minute) automated drone flights using the DroneTM flight
plans.
- Process the resulting data into orthophoto images, Digital Elevation Models,
and 3D meshes (using OpenDroneMap as part of the DroneTM back end)
- Import the orthophoto images into QGIS for visualization. We won't have
time - or scope - to get into use and analysis of the imagery, but people will
be able to get it loaded up into a QGIS canvas and ready for use.

We hope to welcome participants who are:
- From, working with, or supporting communities with actual needs and/or
projects that can benefit from aerial imagery and data. We especially hope to
welcome those who have not been able to access drone technology due to barriers
related to cost and complexity.
- Interested in testing, supporting, or using drone technology and meeting
like-minded folks
- Interested in advocating to regulatory agencies, donors, and other
stakeholders to promote inclusive, community-based drone empowerment
- Due to existing inequities in the drone and tech sector, women will be
prioritized for hands-on practical flight operations experience

##### Join the HOT Tech team for a Community Drone Mapping Workshop!
**Tuesday (15 July), 09:00-13:00 @ PA11**

- 9:00 - 9:15: Introduction of presenters, facilitators, and participants
- 9:15 - 9:30: Overview of DroneTM purpose and usage
- 9:30 - 10:00: Project Creation; define an AOI and parameters for imagery needed
- 10:00 - 10:20: Introduction to operator usage of DroneTM on phone (web app),
download flight plans, inspect them, and load them onto the drones
- 10:20 - 10:30: Break (possibly also troubleshooting for those who didn't get
their flight plans loaded correctly)
- 10:30 - 10:45: Proceed to outdoor flight location
- 10:45 - 11:00: Pre-flight checklists and safety orientation
- 11:00 - 11:30: Fly!
- 11:30 - 11:45: Return indoors, launch processing
- 11:45 - 12:15: Break + networking. While imagery is processing, participants
will discuss their context and potential uses for drone imagery and data
- 12:15 - 12:45: Viewing results of the flights, loading into QGIS and other
FOSS tools, discussion of possible analysis and use
- 12:45 - 13:00: Session evaluation and questions

##### Collaborative Field Mapping  in Mostar with HOT tech team!
**Friday (18 July), 9:30-10:30 and 16:00-17:00 @ CA01**

**Summary**: Join us in these 2x 1 hour sessions  (morning and afternoon
session) to get hands-on experience using the Field Tasking Manager (
**{{< extlink
  href="https://fmtm.hotosm.org"
  title="https://fmtm.hotosm.org" >}}**
).  We will use the imagery
collected during the community drone mapping workshop on Tuesday 15 July !

You will get to collaborate with people in this fun and engaging session. You
will be introduced to the Field-Tasking Manager and how to use it on your phone
(first 10mins in the conference room),  then you go and start the data collection
process outside in the conference venue.  We will give you directions on where
to go. At the end of this session you will have an idea of how you can
contribute as a mapper or potentially set up a project using the Field Tasking
Manager.
