Joana is a data engineer and a data scientist, with 15+ years experience and a
strong expertise in the field of geospatial tech and analytics.

After acquiring a PhD in GIS, at UCL, her drive to solve real-world problems
has led her to SMEs, an international organisation, a research foundation and
a start-up. Joana has been very involved with FOSS, in particular in what
concerns geospatial. This has led her to become a charter member and a board
member of OSGeo. Joana is the founder of ByteRoad, an R&D SME in the field
of Spatial Data Infrastructures. She is also a reviewer for the European
Commission, and has been involved in education, teaching the next generation
of full-stack developers and data analysts. As Developer Relations at OGC,
Joana is responsible for connecting the OGC standards with the wider developer
community, increasing their adoption and contributing towards making them more
developer-friendly.
