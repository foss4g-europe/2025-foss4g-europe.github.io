The European Space Agency (ESA) serves as Europe's gateway to space, with a mission to shape 
the development of Europe's space capability and ensure that investment in space continues to 
deliver benefits to the citizens of Europe and the world. ​

ESA's ambitious vision includes increasing European autonomy, leadership, and responsibility
 in space over the next three years and beyond. ​

By coordinating the financial and intellectual resources of its 22 member states, ESA 
undertakes programs and activities far beyond the scope of any single European 
country, reinforcing Europe's position as a leader in space exploration and geospatial intelligence.
