I am currently external associate at University of Zagereb, FER where I am
working as a lecturer on Geospatial Databases. My research interests, besides
spatial data, also cover fields of data engineering and cloud analytics.
My work primarily focuses on modelling and implementing data warehouses and
data lakes, where I am currently mostly focused on their implementations in
the cloud environments.
