GeoCat provides advanced software and services that make publishing geographic and open
 data on the internet easier and more efficient than ever. Our expert developers play a leading 
role in open-source software, creating sustainable applications based on Open Standards and 
the Free and Open Source software philosophy.

Trusted by organizations such as the Dutch Cadastre (National Geo Register), Rijkswaterstaat,
 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Canada
 (ECCC), multiple national portals in and outside of Europe, and the European INSPIRE geoportal,
