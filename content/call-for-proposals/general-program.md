description: "FOSS4G Europe is the regional
flagship event of OSGeo - an open, grassroots and dynamic community. We are
looking for novel and original submissions on development, use, and advocacy
for FOSS4G over a wider array of topics ranging from state-of-software to
specific use cases, from building and sustaining a community to building a
business around FOSS4G technology, from software technical details to
democratic processes and policy making."
