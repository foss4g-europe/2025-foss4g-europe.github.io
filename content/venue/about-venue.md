Mostar has a deep and complex history, dating back to the 15th century during the
Ottoman Empire. Its name is derived from the word "mostari", meaning “bridge
 keepers,” referring to the guardians of the Stari Most (Old Bridge) — the city's
most famous landmark.

Today, Mostar is a dynamic blend of East and West, where Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian,
and Mediterranean influences converge. It offers charming streets lined with traditional
markets, cozy cafés, and riverside terraces, as well as a growing tech and innovation 
scene.

Its walkable layout, welcoming atmosphere, and breathtaking surroundings make
Mostar a perfect host for FOSS4G Europe 2025 — and an unforgettable place to explore.
