##Map Submissions Open!

We know it's been a busy season, and a few of you reached out about
missing the original deadline for the FOSS4G 2025 Map Gallery 
submissions. So... we’ve decided to give everyone a little more time!

**Map submission is now open until July 14th!
**Submit your stunning cartographic creations at info-europe@foss4g.org with the subject
line "First Name, Last Name - Map Gallery."

Whether it’s beautiful, bold, interactive, or classic — we want to see your maps!
Don't let your masterpiece sit in a folder. Share it with the FOSS4G community! 



**Note!** the Map Gallery submissions will be opened soon. We will announce it
on our social media channels.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the adoption of GIS technologies is limited, and
data accessibility remains a challenge. Our Map Gallery initiative aims to
showcase the power of GIS by creating maps based on available data about Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Accepted maps will be printed and distributed to public
institutions—including ministries, public enterprises, institutes, and local
authorities—to demonstrate the potential of GIS technologies.

Participation Criteria:
- Use of FOSS Tools: Maps must be created using Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS).
- Open Data Utilization: Submissions should be based solely on open data,
with appropriate attribution.
- Focus on Bosnia and Herzegovina: Maps should depict data related to
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- Licensing: Submissions must be licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
- Software and Author Attribution: The map must clearly indicate the
software used for its creation and the author's name.
