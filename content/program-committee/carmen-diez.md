I'm Degree in Civil Engineering and Master in Environmental Engineering and
Management of Water. Actually I work in Regional Ministry of Environment and
Spatial Planning in Madrid Government, using GIS in urban planning and spatial
development general management. Before that I worked modelling with GIS in
environmental flow regime, surface water quality and hydraulic modeling flood
watersheds of Spain.

I’m an enthusiastic and committed to Geographic Information Systems and to promoting the
use and development of FOSS4G through the development of communities. In addition to my
participation in
**{{< extlink href="https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/User:Clds1" title="OSGeo" >}}**,
I belong, as an active member of the boards, of several communities like
**{{< extlink href="https://qgis.es" title="QGIS España Association" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://geoinquietos.org/grupos/madrid/" title="Geoinquietos Madrid" >}}**,
and **{{< extlink href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:LatAm/Grupos/GeoChicas" title="GeochicasOSM" >}}**.

In the last ten years, I have attended and contributed in several local,
national and international events in many of their annual editions:
**{{< extlink href="https://www.jornadassiglibre.org/" title="SIGLibre" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://github.com/geocamp-es" title="Geocamp" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://plugins.qgis.org/planet/tag/qgis%20user%20conference/" title="QGIS User Conference" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://2019.qgis.es/" title="QGIS Hackfest" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://www.mygeoproject.eu/my-geochicas-mapping-the-streets-of-women-in-zaragoza/" title="MyGeo" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://propuestas-libregeo.eslib.re/2023/charlas/calles-mujeres-aragon-geochicasosm" title="esLibre" >}}**,
**{{< extlink href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Jornadas_WMES/2023/Programa" title="Wikimedia National Conference" >}}**,
etc..

I want to contribute so that OSGeo can promote the use of FOSS4G around the
world and for all people in a more effective way. For this reason, I consider
it strategic to complement the most diverse possible visions. Strengthen
efforts for a more numerous, more protagonist and more diverse participation
of women from all over the world. Promote a greater direct relationship
between local chapters of the same region and exchanges between different
regions, for example, through the participation in regional conferences of
representatives of regions other than those that organize it.
