## GeoChicas Take Mostar
**Tuesday, 15 July 2025**  

GeoChicas are an international womenâ€™s mapping community with members in more
than 12 different countries. Our aim is for women to have a greater presence and
participation in key OSM events, increase female participation and leadership,
and work on mapping projects which benefit women. Our main focus as a group is
to help close the gender gap in the OSM community across participation, data
creation and curation.

Everyone is welcome to join the GeoChicas Take Mostar event on 15 July after the
B2B meeting.

GeoChicas Take Mostar is an event where to meet other women and allies attending
FOSS4GE 2025 who are interested in closing the gender gap and working towards
diversity in our communities. **The first hour is only for women and people
identifying as women but afterwards, everyone is welcome!**

You can secure your ticket during your Conference registration on pretix system.

**The event is completely free but your registration will help us plan the
activities and food better!**
