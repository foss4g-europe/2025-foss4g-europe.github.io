Tech Partnership and Engagement Lead at
**{{< extlink href="https://www.hotosm.org/" title="HOT" >}}**.

Originally from Bulgaria, I am currently based in Bristol, UK. I am really
passionate about the impact of open mapping and using technology as the enabler
for people in supporting their communities. In this role, I hope to be able to
successfully build a dynamic collective of open tech contributors from
around the world!

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Development from the
University of Sussex and an MSc in Economics (Development) from the University
of Bath, UK. I started my career working for the UK’s Economic and Social
Science Research Council (ESRC), leading a portfolio of research programs in
international development. I then transitioned into the world of open data and
fell in love with it and especially the people and communities there! Over the
past five years, I worked for the International Aid Transparency Initiative
(IATI) where I provided direct support to many developments and humanitarian
organizations in publishing open data, managed various open tech products, and
organized training and community workshops in Senegal, Nepal, and Tanzania.
