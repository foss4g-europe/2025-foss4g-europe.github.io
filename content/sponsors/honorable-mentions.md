It’s incredible to witness random acts of kindness — people giving 
generously for the good of the community.

We are deeply grateful to everyone who chose to participate in this
year’s [**Adopt-a-ticket**](../../registration/adopt-a-ticket/)program.
By covering the cost of tickets for workshop instructors, travel grant
recipients, and **{{<

    title="workshop instructors"
    target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
>}}**, you’ve helped make FOSS4G Europe 2025
more inclusive, diverse, and accessible.

These gestures remind us what open 
source is really about — people supporting people.

Thank you for being part of that spirit.
