## Description

Workshops are practical hands-on sessions to acquire new know-how in the use of
FOSS4G software. They should showcase current and emerging technologies, and
provide a direct interaction between our highly skilled OSGeo community members
and the public at large who want to learn something new or consolidate their
skills. We are expecting participants to be working alongside and hands-on
for at least 80% of the time spent in workshops.

Workshop slots are **4 hours** long and take place two days prior to the main
conference days. We expect workshop participants to bring their own laptops.
Please indicate clearly if prior installation of any specific software is
required.

When submitting a workshop, please use the abstract to make the scope and
contents clear. Inclusion of a list of topics you want to cover is very
welcome. Ideally, you should also list the prerequisite skills e.g. basic
skills in Python programming are required.

You will also be asked to indicate the level of difficulty on a scale of
1 (beginner) to 3 (highly advanced) for the workshop.

**_Please, keep in mind this is a Free and Open Source Software conference.
Submissions promoting restricted license / closed source software will not
be accepted._**

The FOSS4G Europe 2025 Local Organizing Committee understands the huge body
of work that goes into preparing a successful and educative workshop.
Therefore each accepted workshop is entitled to two complimentary tickets to
the conferenceâ€™s main program for its presenters.

## Selection Process
We will have a two-week **open community vote** on the submitted workshops.
The result of the community vote will be taken as a recommendation, but the
last decision lies with the volunteer
[**Program Committee**](/program-committee/). The community
vote is essential for us to assign rooms and capacity planning for participants
to get the best FOSS4G experience.
