I’m Marko Puljić, born in Mostar and educated at the Faculty of Economics,
University of Zagreb. For the last 11 years, I’ve worked with Ecoplan, one of
the largest consulting companies in Bosnia and Herzegovina specializing in
spatial planning and urbanism. My background in economics has given me a unique
lens through which I approach geospatial analysis and planning, combining
data-driven decision-making with the strategic insights necessary for impactful
spatial projects.

As of my knowledge, economists are a scarce commodity in the GIS field. I
believe my niche expertise bridges a critical gap, allowing me to contribute
fresh perspectives to GIS solutions that support sustainable development and
urban planning. I’m deeply committed to the open-source GIS community, where
I can apply my knowledge to develop accessible tools and foster data
transparency. Alongside my professional work, I’m a GIS enthusiast and an
IT hobbyist, passionate about exploring new technologies that can make a
real-world difference in communities across the Balkan region and beyond.
