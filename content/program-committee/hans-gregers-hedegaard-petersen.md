Greg is an open source and open data advocate. Though he started as a
statistical consultant and developer (using FOSS like Debian, R, etc), he
ended up in the geo business. Now he consults clients on several areas
regarding geodata - mostly within the use of geodata and GIS at public admin
clients. He has a strong belief in Open Data, and co-founded the company
Septima in January 2013 to utilize the newly released national data.
Today Septima employs 30 people. Greg is an avid speaker on the subject of
Open Data, and teaches courses on PostGIS, GeoServer etc. at
company and university level.
