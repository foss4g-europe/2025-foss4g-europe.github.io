The following are the full length, uncut and unedited recordings of the streams.
We are working on getting them cut up and edited presentation-by-presentation
too, and will then upload to
**{{<
    extlink href="https://video.osgeo.org/c/foss4geurope/video-playlists"
    title="OSGeo PeerTube"
>}}**, **{{<
    extlink href="https://av.tib.eu/publisher/FOSS4G"
    title="TIB-AV"
>}}**, and **{{<
    extlink href="https://www.youtube.com/@FOSS4G/playlists"
    title="YouTube"
>}}** channels.

Until then they are rewatchable here, but will be removed later on so please do
not yet reference or link to them.
