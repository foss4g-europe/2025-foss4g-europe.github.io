  caption: "Temperatire and winds recorded in Mostar during FOSS4G Europe 2025 Conference"
  description: "This map demonstrates an innovative GPU-accelerated weather analysis system that transforms global NOAA GraphCast weather data into high-resolution storm and flood risk assessments using Free and Open Source Software. Created with Python, CuPy (GPU processing), H3 spatial indexing, and visualized in Kepler.gl, the system processes weather forecasts through advanced topographic corrections using Copernicus DEM data to identify flood-prone areas, track severe weather patterns, and assess wind hazards at sub-kilometer resolution. The H3 hexagonal grid visualization shows real-time atmospheric instability indicators, moisture flux convergence zones, and precipitation patterns enhanced by orographic effects ... critical information for emergency management, urban planning, and disaster preparedness that could benefit ministries, local authorities, and public safety institutions across Bosnia and Herzegovina."
