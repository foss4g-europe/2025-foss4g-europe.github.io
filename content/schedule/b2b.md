##  Business-to-business (B2B)

The B2B networking event offers a unique opportunity to connect with businesses,
experts, and fellow participants in a relaxed atmosphere by the beautiful
Neretva River.

Sponsors will also have the chance to present themselves in a
**2-minute pitch**, making this an excellent platform to increase visibility
and explore collaboration opportunities.

Appetizers, snacks, and beverages will be provided during the event.  
And the best part? This happens **right before the main conference starts**,
giving you a head start in building meaningful connections!

**Please note:** This event is available
**only to those who have purchased a B2B ticket**.  

We look forward to welcoming you in Mostar!
