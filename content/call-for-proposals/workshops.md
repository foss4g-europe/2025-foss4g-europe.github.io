description: "FOSS4G Europe is the regional
flagship event of OSGeo - an open, grassroots and dynamic community.
Workshops are the practical hands-on sessions to acquire new know-how in the
use of FOSS4G software. They should showcase current and emerging technologies,
and provide a direct interaction between our highly skilled OSGeo community
members and the public at large who want to learn something new or consolidate
their skills."
